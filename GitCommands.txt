🧭 Typical Workflow
1. Make sure you’re on the right branch
git status
git branch


If you’re on main, great. If not:

git checkout main

2. Add and commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"

3. Push to the staging branch (main)
git push origin main


This will trigger your staging Netlify build automatically (if Netlify is watching this branch).

🚀 After testing staging

Once staging looks good and you’re ready to deploy to production:

4. Merge staging (main) into production (prod)
git checkout prod
git merge main

5. Push to the production branch
git push origin prod


Netlify will automatically deploy your production site.
